Please contribute
=================

#. Go to the page with the latest snippet

#. Use the usual "Edit me on Github" workflow and add your snippet at the top.

#. Send a PULL REQUEST

#. Provide at least title, name, date, keywords, description and code.

#. Don't worry: The documentation team will help you with the details of
   text markup.

#. In general: While it's nice to have a similar structure for the snippets,
   this is not a requirement any more. So you may have several descriptions
   and code passages in your contribution.

#. You have collected a whole bunch of snippets and would like to have them
   added? Get in contact with the `TYPO3 documentation team! <documentation@typo3.org>`__
